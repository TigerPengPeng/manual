#  JMX Tutorial Introductory Example : Instrumenting Your Own Applications.
#                                      Using Notifications.
#
#  This example is the same as the previous essential example with the
#  only difference that the Hello World MBean has been modified to send
#  notifications.
#
#  The Hello World MBean implements the NotificationBroadcaster interface
#  by extending the NotificationBroadcasterSupport class and emits
#  AttributeChangeNotifications every time the CacheSize attribute
#  is changed.
#

#
# In order to compile and run the example, make a copy of this README file, and
# then simply cut and paste all the commands as needed into a terminal window.
#
# This README makes the assumption that you are running under Java SE 6 on Unix,
# you are familiar with the JMX technology, and with the bourne shell or korn
# shell syntax.
#
# All the commands below are defined using Unix korn shell syntax.
#
# If you are not running Unix and korn shell you are expected to be able to
# adapt these commands to your favorite OS and shell environment.
#

# Compile Java classes
#
# The Java classes used in this example are contained in the com.example.mbeans
# Java package.
#
# * Main.java: gets the Platform MBean Server, and creates
#              and registers the Hello World MBean on it.
#
# * Hello.java: implements the Hello World standard MBean.
#               This MBean emits notifications every time
#               the CacheSize attribute is changed.
#
# * HelloMBean.java: the management interface exposed by
#                    the Hello World standard MBean.

javac com/example/mbeans/*.java

# Start the Main application

java com.example.mbeans.Main

# Start jconsole on a different shell window on the same machine
#
# JConsole is located in $(J2SE_HOME)/bin/jconsole
